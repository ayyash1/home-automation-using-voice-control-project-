# Home Automation System Using Voice Control (Google Home Integration) with ESP32

This project demonstrates a home automation system that allows you to control your smart devices using voice commands through the **Google Home app**. The system is powered by **ESP32** and connected to the **Sinric Pro API** for seamless device control. You can control the devices from anywhere in the world using the Google Home app linked to your phone.

## Features:
- **Voice Control**: Control devices using voice commands through Google Home.
- **Remote Control**: Access and control the system from anywhere via the Google Home app.
- **ESP32 Integration**: ESP32 as the central hub for managing devices.
- **Sinric Pro API**: Integrated with Sinric Pro API to control smart devices.

## Prerequisites:
- **ESP32** microcontroller.
- **Google Home app** installed on your phone.
- **Sinric Pro account** to obtain the API key.
- **Arduino IDE** to upload the code to the ESP32.

## Setup Instructions:
1. **Clone the repository**:
